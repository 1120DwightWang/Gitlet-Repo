# Gitlet-Repo
This is where I store the codes for Gitlet, a light version of Github. 
I initially committed my codes to the private repository owned by CS61B during the Summer Session 2022, as tracked by the contributions on my profile page.
Afterwards, I uploaded my codes to this public repository so that the Master's program admissions officials could verify the validity of my coding skills. 
Before running the codes, all the files in the library-su22 should be loaded in IntelliJ library.
